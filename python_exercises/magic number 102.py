# Magic number game!

# I want you to use operators
# equate something

# As a user, I want to be able to guess a number and know if i got it correct or not, so that I can know if I won or not.
# We should define/assign number to a variable called magic_number

# magic_number =
magic_number = 15

# I need to ask user for input
number = int(input('Choose a number between 0-10: '))

# I need to check if this input matches a magic_number
if magic_number == number:
    # I need to let the user know if the response was write or not
    print('You guessed the number correctly!')
else:
    print('You were wrong')

#self five
