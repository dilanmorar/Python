# oop basics
object oriented programming basics

## abstraction
- handles complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
- showcasing only the required things to the outside world while hiding the details
## inheritance
- one class acquires the property of another class
- allows code reusability when a class includes property of another class
## class
- a class is a collection of method and variables.
- it is a blueprint that defines the data and behavior of a type
## instance
- is a specific realization of any object
## object
- s nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make  data useful
- object determines the behaviour of the class
- can be a data structure, a variable or a function
## methods vs functions
- methods and functions are the same, with different terms.
- a method is a procedure or function in object-oriented programming.
- a function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program
## characteristics vs behaviours
